          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            This project will allow users to catalogue physical media that they
            own. Much of the media that the average person consumes comes from
            streaming services like Netflix, Hulu etc. Due to this most of the
            media that people make use of does not belong to them. Because of
            this access to media for most people is dependent on having the
            correct subscription services and that these services will continue
            to license the media that you want to see. In response to this many
            people have made the decision to start collecting physical media
            again like DVDs. This website's goal is to allow users to catalogue
            what physical media they own so that they can track their collection
            as it grows. Once the website is complete, users will be able to
            sort through their owned media by type (DVD, Vinyl, Game, etc.) and
            they will be able to view each item they own with information
            displayed about them (Names, release date, company, etc.) including
            pricing trends so they may see how the value of their collection has
            changed over time.
