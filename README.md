# MediaCollection2

This project will allow users to catalogue physical media that they own. Much of the media that
the average person consumes comes from streaming services like Netflix, Hulu etc. Due to this most of
the media that people make use of does not belong to them. Because of this access to media for most
people is dependent on having the correct subscription services and that these services will continue to
license the media that you want to see. In response to this many people have made the decision to start
collecting physical media again like DVDs. This website's goal is to allow users to catalogue what physical
media they own so that they can track their collection as it grows. Once the website is complete, users
will be able to sort through their owned media by type (DVD, Vinyl, Game, etc.) and they will be able to
view each item they own with information displayed about them (Names, release date, company, etc.)
including pricing trends so they may see how the value of their collection has changed over time.
For this project I will be using JavaScript + HTML / CSS. The IDE I will be using is Visual Studio
Code. For the website's database I will be using XAMPP. For the website's layout and styling I will use
Bootstrap. For tracking the value of items, I will be using eBay's publicly available commerce API to track
sales to determine and display pricing trends.
